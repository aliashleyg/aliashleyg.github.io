## Game Play Instructions:
* Click any card to start the game.
* Click a second card.
* If the cards, match, you may choose two more cards; if the cards do not match, they will be turned back over and then you will be able to choose two more cards.
* The game continues until all cards have been turned over and matched.

## Scoring
The purpose of this game is to find all of the matches in the fewest number of turns possible and/or as quickly as possible. 

* The timer begins when the first card is clicked and ends when the last match is found.
* A move is counted when two cards have been turned over, regardless of if they match or do not match.
* The game begins with 5 solid stars. A star is removed for every three turns that do not reveal a match. A blinking star means that you have one more turn before the star disappears.

## Additional Gameplay Information
* A restart button is provided, should you want to start the game over. Please note that if you restart your game, all progress of the current game will be deleted.
* You will receive notification once the game is over on your score: the number of stars you have retained, the number of moves needed to complete the game, and how long (in seconds) it took for you to find all of the matches. 

## About the Game
This game was built as a project for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program to display knowledge and comprehension of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. A special shout out to Luiz Mai, a Udacity mentor, for his help with this project.
